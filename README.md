### Results/Findings
1. A couple of noticeable drops in the conversion rate: first, from the start of the session to product view (-79%); second, from product view to add to cart (-80%); and finally, from checkout to purchase (-56%).
2. There is a weekly pattern in both the number of visitors and the conversion rate. The number of users and the conversion rate increase at the beginning of the week (Monday) and decline during the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).

### Recomendation
1. Revise the SEO optimization strategy. Since most traffic comes from organic sources, the initial drop in the conversion rate suggests that visitorsâ€™ expectations do not match the actual website experience.
2. Conduct UX testing. A confusing website structure could also be a reason for the drop in conversions.
