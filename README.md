### Resuls/Findings
1. Couple noticable drops of conversion rate, at the beginning, from start of the session to product view(-79%), then from product view to add to cart (-80%) and from checkout to purchase (-56%).
2. There is a periodicity in number of visitors and conversion rate through the weeks. Number of users and conversion rate rise at the beginning of the week (monday) and fall at the weekends (saturday, sunday).

### Recomendation
1. Revise seo optimization strategy, because most of the traffic comes from organic source, drop of conversion rate at first interaction suggests that expectations of visitors don't meet the reality.
2. UX tests, confusing structure of a website also can be a reason of conversion drop.
